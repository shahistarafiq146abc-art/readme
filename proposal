1. Introduction

Education systems often treat all students equally, assuming that they learn at the same pace and in the same manner. However, students differ in learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses. Precision education focuses on individual learning needs to improve academic performance.

This project proposes a simple and cost-effective system that uses machine learning to provide personalized study recommendations to students based on their performance and preferred learning style.

2. Problem Statement

Students face difficulties in identifying their weak areas and often follow a random study pattern. Teachers also lack sufficient insight into individual student learning styles. There is a need for a system that:

Monitors student performance

Identifies learning gaps

Suggests personalized study plans

3. Objectives
Primary Objectives

To develop a system that recommends personalized study material.

To analyze students’ learning styles and performance.

Secondary Objectives

To help students use study time more efficiently.

To provide progress tracking for continuous improvement.

4. Scope of the Project

The project focuses on:

Students of any academic level (school, college, university)

Machine learning-based performance analysis

Personalized recommendations based on datasets or self-entered values

To keep the project simple:

Only a few subjects (e.g., Math, English, Programming) will be tested

Dataset will be small and manageable

5. Proposed System
Input:

Basic student profile

Marks/quiz results

Preferred learning style (visual, reading, practice-based)

System Process:

ML Model analyzes performance

Identifies weak areas

Suggests recommended topics and resources

Output:

Personalized study plan

Recommended chapters/topics

Suggested learning materials (notes, videos, quizzes)

6. Machine Learning Approach

Dataset: Small dataset (custom made using student surveys)

Algorithm: Logistic Regression / Random Forest (simple & efficient)

Goal: To detect weak topics and suggest improvements

7. Key Features

Student performance input

Automatic weak topic detection

Personalized learning recommendations

Simple dashboard interface

8. Tools & Technologies

Frontend: HTML / Bootstrap (Simple UI)

Backend: Python Flask (Lightweight)

ML Framework: Scikit-learn

Database: SQLite / Firebase

Model Deployment: Flask API

9. Expected Results

Students receive personalized learning suggestions

Improvement in learning efficiency

AI-enhanced precision education approach

10. Benefits

Easy to implement

Machine learning applied in a simple and useful manner

Time-saving for students

Low-cost solution

11. Project Timeline
Phase	Duration
Requirements Study	1 week
Dataset Preparation	2 weeks
Model Implementation	3 weeks
Web Interface	3 weeks
Testing	2 weeks
Documentation	1 week
12. Limitations

Accuracy depends on data quality

Only recommendation-based output (not chatbot tutoring)

Subjects limited to initial dataset

13. Conclusion

The project aims to use ML in a simple, smart and efficient way to promote precision learning. It offers real benefit to students without needing complex datasets or advanced algorithms, making it an ideal FYP.
